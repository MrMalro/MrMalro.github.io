### CPSC 120

* Lab 5
    Lab 5, Part 3 was one of my favorites because I’ve always been interested in card games such as blackjack, and always wondered what the “behind the scenes” is for these card games. I liked this one better than the Lab 7 one since we had all of the code in one place and it made sense for me that way. Also, we coded to have it say Bust or Winner whether you went over 21 or not. 
* Lab 8
    Lab 8 Part 3 was another favorite because this was the Halloween animation one which was pretty cool to see how we can code an animation like that. Since the labs before, we would either code a game or code something to make its function simpler, it was interesting to see how vast coding can get. Also, this opened my mind to different ideas of coding other animated figures for the future.
* Lab 10
    Lab 10 Part 3 was also a favorite of mine since this was the first lab where we got to actually create something from coding, which was the image. The image also had a cool color scheme to it since it was fading from one color to another. It was a bit confusing at first but after we figured it out, it was really rewarding to see the final product of that color gradient being printed out.
